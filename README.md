* Python1: Get stock data from FindMind and save to CSV
    - [FindMind-fetch_and_save_stock_data.py](FindMind-fetch_and_save_stock_data.py) is generated by ChatGPT based on the [insctructions-1](instructions-1.md) that First download [auction CSV]() as local [auction_data.csv](auction_data.csv) and its columns `股票代號`,`公司名稱`,`申請日期`,`上櫃審議委員會審議日期`,`櫃買董事會通過上櫃日期`,`櫃買同意上櫃契約日期`,`投標開始日(T-4)`,`投標結束日(T-2)`,`開標日期(T)`,`撥券日(上市上櫃日) T+7`,`DateStart`,`DateEnd+14` where `DateStart` and `DateEnd+14` is the monitoring period of the event 'Auction' of each company.
    
    - By FindMind API, Monitoring period day K data are received of each company and save as csv file name as ['[7712]%202024-06-27-2025-01-15.csv']([7712]%202024-06-27-2025-01-15.csv)- which file name ruled as [xxxx] yyyy-mm-dd-YYYY-MM-DD where xxxx is stock id,  yyyy-mm-dd is start day, YYYY-MM-DD is ending day.

    - In the CSV, row start from day yyyy-mm-dd to day YYYY-MM-DD. Each row are columned as `日期`,`股票代碼`,`成交量`,`成交金額`,`開盤價`,`最高價`,`最低價`,`收盤價`,`漲跌幅`,`交易筆數` (which is Day K line data).

    - command line of the code is as

```
python FindMind-fetch_and_save_stock_data.py >output.log 2>&1
```

* Python2: from CSV pick data by date
    - command line of the code is as

```
python FindMind-read_stock_data_by_date.py  >output2.log 2>&1
```
* Python3: check the missing date by holiday.csv to check complete or not
    - command line of the code is as

```
python create_holiday.py  >output3.log 2>&1
```
* Python4: 
    - FindMind-read_{xxxx}.py is generated by Claude based on the [insctructions-2](instructions-2.md)
```
python FindMind-read_PER_PBR.py >output4.log 2>&1
```
* Python5: 
    - the same as Python4
    - command line of the code is as
```
python FindMind-read_company-profile.py >output5.log 2>&1
```
* Python6: 
    - the same as Python4
    - command line of the code is as
```
python FindMind-read_dividend.py >output6.log 2>&1
